<h2 class="heading-12" style="text-transform: capitalize;">Why Learn About Personality</h2>
<div class="jp-why-learn-wrapper">
<p class="paragraph-4">Every day, you have to interact with yourself as well as other people in your family, work,
and romantic relationships. Each of them has a unique personality.<br><br></b>People are different, and it can
be challenging to understand other perspectives because you see the world through the lens of your own
particular personality.<br><br>Although personality differences can be frustrating, they are important. Each
personality type is evolved to solve a different kind of problem. Humans cooperate in societies by solving many
kinds of problems together, through these diverse personality types.</p>
<p>Through this course, you can learn to understand yourself and others better, and to more effectively cooperate
with other people.</p>

<h3 class="heading-13">“Thank you, Jordan Peterson, for opening my eyes.”</h3>
<p class="paragraph-11">I might not be unique saying this course was extremely useful to me. But still it is
so. Every lecture gave a lot of thought, so I would outline just a few examples why I consider this course
very helpful.</p>
</br>
<p class="paragraph-11">I always felt that I was an agreeable person, so I was so interested to know that
agreeable people are paid less for the same job than disagreeable, which correlated with my experience &
thus showed me areas to improve to be able to have more bargaining power the next time.</p>
</br>
<p class="paragraph-11">Lecture on men & women personality differences was an eye opener to me that we are
more the same than we are different, which made me feel I can understand women better.</p>
</br>
<p class="paragraph-11">In the end, I would like to say I have deep respect for Jordan Peterson. Moreover I
am extremely grateful for his desire to help people, in this case to help people understand themselves and
others better. His desire coupled with his talent, deep scientific knowledge, achievements and ability to
explain so clearly makes his help so much more efficient. Dominic Sandbrook said about Jordan Peterson
that he is ‘a prophet for our times’, which strikes me as highly probable!

very valuable, both in gaining insights into my own personality, behaviours, and relationships and also in
understanding some implications of the &#x27;Big Five&#x27; personality traits as they operate in the
broader society. I found the &#x27;Understand Myself&#x27; (Big Five) personality assessment to be very
accurate and applicable as I listened to the lectures.<br>It&#x27;s helped me to understand some of my
relationships with others better, as promised, and will likely continue to provide insights into the

all students.<br>Dr. Peterson&#x27;s <i>discovering personality</i> course is life changing. I have read,
watched many online available materials from Dr. Peterson and the decision to purchase the course is one
of my best decisions in 2020. Though topics are very broad, I think Dr. Peterson covered the essence that
we can further imagine and realize on our own the personalities of people we are meeting. I feel like I
now have a powerful weapon which I can decode not only other people but myself as well. Also Dr.
Peterson&#x27;s vast knowledge, the experience and the examples have answered many of the questions I had
regarding my friends and behaviors of people I met. Even now I have a better understanding about other
people&#x27;s political views. I have truly gained new knowledge and I&#x27;m very thankful for Dr.
Peterson for offering this course to outsiders. I think it&#x27;s not an exaggeration if I say that this
course is the best course to Understanding yourself and others in a very short period of time.<br><br></p>

<p class="jp-big5-description">This course is based on the Big Five Personality Model. </p>
<br>
<p class="jp-big5-description"> The Big Five personality traits, also known as the five-factor model (FFM), or by
the mnemonic “OCEAN”,
is a taxonomy for personality traits. Scientists developed the five-factor model following statistical analysis of
the language people use to describe other people. They found that personality adjectives tended to clump into five
major categories.</p>
<br>
<p class="jp-big5-description">The five-factor model emerged from this, and it includes the following traits:</p>

<h5>Introductory Lecture</h5>
<p class="jp-lecture-paragraph">The introductory lecture is an interview with Dr. Peterson discussing the big
picture behind the course and its origins. These lectures are the result of years of research, thought,
debate, and intellectual refinement. He also speaks about what you will learn in the course and why it is
valuable in the present day.<br><br>“You spend a tremendous amount of your time engaging with other people.
You need to understand what they’re like, and you need to understand what you’re like. People are actually
quite different. If you know what the differences are, that means you can cooperate with them better, and
compete with them better, and all of that’s positive.”

<h5>lecture 1</h5>
<p class="jp-lecture-paragraph">This lecture introduces the philosophical and psychological underpinnings of
personality theory and why you should learn about personality.<br>
<p class="jp-lecture-paragraph">Dr. Peterson argues that personalities are evolved solutions to the problem of a
highly complex world. Our personalities are the filters of our perception, cognition, and motivation
influencing our actions in the world.

<p class="jp-lecture-paragraph">This lecture introduces the five-factor model, which will form the basis of the
course.<br><br>“The concept of grit, for example, is essentially the same as conscientiousness, meaning it
doesn’t measure anything you can’t get from conscientiousness. The concept of self-esteem is positive emotion
(extraversion) minus negative emotion (neuroticism).”

pronounced advantages and disadvantages to being at any point on the spectrum.”

<div class="jp-accordion-item-content">
<p class="jp-faq-paragraph"><i>Discovering Personality</i> offers a wide spectrum of actionable advice for
every dimension of your life influenced by personality.
But please note that it's not a specialized relationship course, a career progression course, or a
self-mastery course.
In many cases, you'll be invited to first internalize a specific fact or insight regarding personality - and
then take your own initiative to apply that wisdom in a way that's meaningful to you.
The vast majority of people who take this course report tangible and profound outcomes in many areas of
their lives. You most likely will too - and remember that you have 15 risk-free days to test it risk-free,
and decide if that's true for you.

<div class="jp-arrow-accordion"></div>
</div>
<div class="jp-accordion-item-content">
<p class="jp-faq-paragraph">Human personality is a predictable and consistent science: and the best way to
gain a foundational understanding of it is by first studying the best available framework.
By observing scientific consensus and through decades of his own research, Dr. Peterson has concluded that
the Big Five personality model is that framework.
Once you've completed <i>Discovering Personality</i>, you may wish to broaden your perspective and study
other models. But you'll be hard-pressed to find anything more accurate and actionable than the Big Five.

<p class="jp-faq-paragraph">The eight course lectures total approximately five hours in length. You'll want to
spread these out according to your schedule - but if you commit a short amount of time in your mornings or
evenings, you should be able to complete everything within a week.
Once you've finished the course, you're encouraged (and will likely be inspired to) revisit your lectures
and engage in discussions with the community. How much time you spend on this is up to you.

<p class="jp-faq-paragraph">Dr. Peterson's YouTube videos offer fragments of his key teachings and lectures.
And while they will give you some of the learnings from <i>Discovering Personality</i>, they're not a
complete and structured experience.
<i>Discovering Personality</i> guides you through a meticulous process for understanding human personality -
and gives you the tools, resources, and community you need to absorb and apply your learnings in the
fastest, most efficient way.

understand yourself better, they are completely different courses with different objectives.
In a nutshell, the Self Authoring Suite helps you take control of your life. Whereas <i>Discovering

others.

<p class="jp-faq-paragraph">You enjoy unlimited lifetime access to <i>Discovering Personality</i> with a

refresher - or when a new personality challenge emerges from inside you or from someone around you.
The only time limit is in the money back guarantee: you have 15 days from your date of purchase to explore
the course with full peace of mind, and decide if it's for you. That's more than enough time to absorb
everything it has to offer before making your final decision.
